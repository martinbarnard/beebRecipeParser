# beebRecipeParser
Quick web2py application to parse a wget archive of the bbc recipe site

# Installation

You will need a working copy of web2py (http://www.web2py.com).

- Create a new web2py application
- Copy the contents of this application into folder
- Extract your wget archive of the www.bbc.co.uk/food links (you have one, I assume?) to the application top-level folder (i.e. like applications/beebparser/www.bbc.co.uk)
- Navigate to your app
- Click on Menu > **Build Database**
- Go for coffee/tea/beverage of choice - this could take a while
- Come back to a crappy return page (hopefully not an error message!)
- Click on Menu > **BBC Recipes Index**
- Have Fun

## Something went wrong on import

If you are seeing an error whilst trying to import, then there's something wrong with the parser - feel free to fix it :)

### WARNING WARNING WARNING

Clicking on Truncate Database and then clicking on confirm + send will remove all the data from the database
**You have been warned**
